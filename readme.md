# Restaurant Scraper

üåê **Welcome to the Restaurant Scraper!** üåØ  
A lightweight Python tool built with Selenium to scrape restaurant-related data from websites, starting with a simple Google page scrape as a proof of concept. This project lays the foundation for extracting menus, reviews, or pricing information from restaurant sites.

üìÖ *Last Updated: July 12, 2025, 11:05 PM IST*

## Overview
This project uses Selenium with Chrome WebDriver to automate web browsing and extract data from target websites. The initial implementation demonstrates scraping the title of a Google page, with potential to expand to restaurant-specific data like menus or ratings.

## Features
- üï∏Ô∏è Automated web scraping using Selenium WebDriver.
- üöÄ Dynamic ChromeDriver management with `webdriver_manager`.
- üåç Initial support for scraping page titles (e.g., Google).
- üîß Extensible framework for scraping restaurant details (future enhancement).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later.
- Chrome browser installed.
- `webdriver-manager` for automatic ChromeDriver setup.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-scraper.git
   cd restaurant-scraper
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install selenium webdriver-manager
   ```

## Usage
1. **Activate the Environment**
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

2. **Run the Script**
   ```bash
   python restaurant_scraper.py
   ```
   - This will open a Chrome browser, navigate to Google, print the page title ("Google"), and close.

3. **Customize**
   - Modify the `driver.get("https://www.google.com")` line to target a restaurant website (e.g., `https://www.example-restaurant.com`).
   - Extend the script to extract specific data (e.g., using `driver.find_element` for menus or reviews).

4. **Exit**
   - The browser closes automatically after execution.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for scraping restaurant menus, ratings, or pricing.
- Implement data storage (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Enhance with headless mode for faster scraping.
- Integrate error handling for robust performance.
